# KNN-Model
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms. KNN finds out the similarity between the new data & available data and put the new case into a category that is most similar to the available categories.

KNN is also called a lazy learner algorithm, as it does not learn from the training data immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of prediction, it performs an action on the dataset.

 - It is a Supervised Learning Algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression problems.
 - It can also handle non-linear data which was not possible in case of linear models
 
Advantages :
 - Easy to Implement
 - No Training Period : As the data itself is a model which will be later used as a reference for prediction.
 
Disadvantages :
 - Data needs to be scaled.
 - Sensitive to missing Data.
 - does not work well with Large Dataset.
